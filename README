You'll want to modify config.php and set FULL path to the file you want to store
the DB in. The DB file will need to be writable by the webserver.

If you choose to install the equipment tracker in a subdirectory in the document
root, and access it at http://yourhost.tld/foo/ , change $base_path accordingly
(in this case, to '/foo/').

See the file db.php for a description of the flat file database format. The
default cell seperator is '' (^_), C0 Unit Seperator. It is extremely unlikely
that a user will ever enter this. If you change the cell seperator, be aware
that I do not escape it in new input. Please pick something rarely entered, lest
it be included in input and possibly destroy the row formatting in the DB.

Move the file 'htpasswd' to a location OUTSIDE of your document root and rename
it to .htpasswd . Update the files loans/.htaccess and objects/.htaccess with
the new location of your .htpasswd file. The default login is admin with a
password of SoCETPW (School of Computing Equipment Tracker PassWord). You can
add users by running
        htpasswd /path/to/.htpasswd username


This equipment tracker is distributed under a pseudo-BSD license. Please see the file
COPYING for details.
